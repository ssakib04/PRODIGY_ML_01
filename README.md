There are two files in this repository, namely "Task01" and "house_price_regression_dataset.csv", the CSV file is the dataset which I worked with and the other file is simply an implementation of the line regression model to predict the prices of houses by taking into account various features such as the square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms of the house.
